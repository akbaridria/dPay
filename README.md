# dPay (Cross-Chain Salary Streaming dApp)

## Project Description

Welcome to the Cross-Chain Salary Streaming dApp! This decentralized application empowers Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to streamline salary distributions across multiple blockchain networks while optimizing their funds through integration with Aave V3. Seamlessly create, manage, and withdraw salary streams while earning rewards on idle funds.

## Underlying Technology

The Cross-Chain Salary Streaming dApp is built using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless and secure experience:

- **Axelar GMP:** We leverage the power of the Axelar Global Money Protocol to facilitate cross-chain communication, enabling the dApp to operate smoothly across different blockchain networks.

- **GetBlock:** Our dApp interfaces with the GetBlock infrastructure, allowing for reliable and easy access to blockchain data. This ensures accurate and real-time information for all transactions and activities.

## Yield Source

The yield generated for your DAO comes from the integration with Aave V3. By lending idle funds on Aave's decentralized lending and borrowing markets, your DAO earns interest and rewards, optimizing the use of treasury funds.

## Notes

not all feature is cross-chain compatible, the features that cross-chain compatible are
- create stream
- withdraw stream
- add more fun to the stream

and for claiming reward and cancle the stream you can do it only on goerli/ethereum chain.
