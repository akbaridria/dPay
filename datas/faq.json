    {
      "question": "What does the term \"reward\" refer to in this context?",
      "answer": "The term \"reward\" pertains to the additional value your DAO can earn by utilizing our platform's integration with Aave V3. When your DAO's funds are not actively engaged in salary streaming, they can be strategically invested in Aave V3's lending and borrowing protocols. As a result, your DAO earns interest and yields from these activities, contributing to the overall growth of your treasury."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does the yield come from?",
      "answer": "The yield your DAO earns comes from Aave V3's decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and borrowing markets. Aave V3 operates as a decentralized protocol that allows users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies. Your DAO's funds, when allocated to Aave V3, are utilized by other participants in the DeFi ecosystem. The interest paid by borrowers and the fees from the protocol's operations generate yields, which are then distributed to your DAO as rewards. This mechanism allows your DAO to passively generate earnings from the dynamic and active DeFi landscape, maximizing the potential of your treasury."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are all features within this dApp cross-chain?",
      "answer": "No, not all features are cross-chain. While creating streams and withdrawing are cross-chain compatible, canceling streams and claiming rewards are currently only supported on the Goerli/Ethereum network"
